# IRIS-classificaton-using-KNN
The iris flower have different species and we can distinguish them based on the length and width of petals and sepals.

Steps involved in classifying a iris flower based upon the length and breadth of petals and sepals:
1) First we load the iris dataset.
2) Then we generate a KNN model for classification.
3) Then we give input for sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length and petal_width, based upon which the KNN classifies the iris flower into either of the one: setosa, versicolor, virginica.
4) Then we split the model into train and test sets and again predict the sets.
5) Finally we find the accuracy score of the model.
